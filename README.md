## Overview

This Guidance demonstrates how to implement a secure and scalable one time passcode (OTP) delivery system by integrating AWS End User Messaging with Okta. The solution caters to a diverse user base by supporting multiple languages and communication methods, storing language-specific message templates in a dynamic, scalable database. When a user requests an OTP, Okta's telephony inline hook is activated, creating a request for OTP delivery through AWS. The system personalizes the message by including the OTP code and tailoring it based on the user's language preference and delivery channel, such as SMS or voice call. Additionally, the solution supports phone numbers from multiple countries through the AWS End User Messaging service, which provides coverage for over 240 countries. By leveraging this service, the OTP delivery system can seamlessly handle phone numbers from various countries, ensuring a consistent and reliable experience for users worldwide.

## Prerequisites

1. Install Node.js 14.15.0 or later
2. Install Zip on terminal
3. Production AWS End User Messaging account
4. Dedicated phone number in AWS End User Messaging (short-code, long-code etc.)

Initially, your AWS account will be configured as a Sandbox account within AWS End User Messaging. To move into a production environment and to increase your SMS and Voice Service spend limits, please follow the detailed steps outlined in the AWS End User Messaging [User Guide Open Case](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sms-voice/latest/userguide/sandbox.html#channels-voice-manage-sandbox). Transitioning to a production account will enable you to send messages without the sandbox restrictions.

Additionally, when preparing to send messages, you'll need to acquire a dedicated phone number. For specialized requirements like Short Codes, Toll-Free Numbers, or 10DLC Campaign Numbers, refer to the comprehensive instructions provided in the AWS End User Messaging Phone Numbers [User Guide Phone Numbers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sms-voice/latest/userguide/phone-numbers.html). Keep in mind that carrier considerations such as message throughput, number pooling, carrier filtering policies, compliance with carrier regulations, and delivery rates are crucial factors that can influence your choice of number type and impact the delivery rates and success of your messaging campaigns. It's essential to understand the various throughput limitations, fees, and region-specific regulations associated with different carriers, as well as the need for sender ID registration in certain regions. By taking these carrier considerations into account, you can ensure that your messaging services are both effective and compliant with all relevant guidelines and regulations.

To acquire a US long code for testing purposes, please adhere to the instructions in this guide. Ensure that you select 'Voice only' for the Messaging use case and choose 'Long code' as the originator type. This action will immediately allocate a phone number to your account, which will be restricted to voice call functionalities only. [Request Long Code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sms-voice/latest/userguide/phone-numbers-request.html). 

### Operating System
These deployment instructions are optimized to best work on a Mac or Linux environment. Deployment in Windows may require additional steps for setting up required libraries and CLI.

   - Click the orange "Create stack" button to initiate the deployment.

8. **Monitor Stack Status**:
   - The CloudFormation console will display the status of your stack creation. It may take a few minutes to complete depending on the resources involved.
   - You can monitor the progress and view any potential errors that might occur during deployment.

9. **Outputs**:
   - Once the stack creation is successful, the "Outputs" section will display the generated values like Lambda function ARN, and API Gateway invoke URL etc.

**Additional Notes**:
- You can access the deployed resources (Lambda function, API Gateway, etc.) from their respective service dashboards in the AWS console.

By following these steps, you have accomplished the deployment of your CloudFormation template via the AWS Management Console.
 
## Upload The Lambda API Trigger Function Code

Navigate to the `guidance-for-okta-phone-based-multi-factor-authentication-on-aws/deployment/Lambda-API-Trigger` directory. It is crucial to note that the `index.js` file within the `Lambda-API-Trigger` folder is coded to operate in the `us-east-1` AWS region. Should you intend to deploy your function in a different AWS region, you must modify the region configuration within the code. Specifically, you'll need to alter the variable `aws_region` found on line #5 of the `index.js` file to reflect your target region.

The file `originationIdentities.json` maps two-letter country codes to origination identities (phone numbers, Sender IDs, short codes, ARNs, etc.) associated with the AWS End User Messaging Service. These origination identities must be registered with your AWS Account and listed within the AWS End User Messaging Service Dashboard. The keys represent the two-letter country codes, while the values correspond to the registered origination identities. The origination identity can be a PhoneNumber, PhoneNumberId, PhoneNumberArn, SenderId, SenderIdArn, PoolId, or PoolArn. To add support for a new country, determine the two-letter country code, add a new entry with the country code as the key, and set the value to the appropriate registered origination identity.

Example for France (country code FR) with a phone number as the origination identity

"FR": "+33987654321",

Example for Germany (country code DE) with a Sender ID ARN as the origination identity

"DE": "arn:aws:sms-voice:us-east-1:123456789012:sender-id/ABCDEF/DE"

Inside the `originationIdentities.json` you will find examples, please edit this file with your origination identities for the desired countries. Once you have edited and saved the file you may proceed with **Step 1**. 

1. **Open the Lambda console** at [AWS Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

2. In the **navigation pane** on the left side of the console, choose **Functions**.

3. In the list, **choose the Lambda API Trigger Function** created by CloudFormation.

4. Open a Mac/Linux terminal and navigate to the `guidance-for-okta-phone-based-multi-factor-authentication-on-aws/deployment/Lambda-API-Trigger` directory. 

   Example: `cd /Users/UserName/Desktop/guidance-for-okta-phone-based-multi-factor-authentication-on-aws/deployment/Lambda-API-Trigger`

5. Run the following terminal command to download the latest libphonenumber-js Module.

   Run command: `npm install libphonenumber-js` (node must be installed to run)

Remember: Enabling Provisioned Concurrency will incur additional costs as you're reserving compute capacity regardless of whether it's being used. Adjust the number of provisioned concurrent executions based on your expected load and performance requirements. As new versions are published you will need to update Amazon API Gateway to use the newest version.

By completing these steps, you have successfully deployed your Lambda Function via the AWS Lambda Console. Please ensure that you adjust the region value within the code to match your targeted AWS region if it differs from the default 'us-east-1' region.

## Upload the Lambda Authorizer Trigger Function Code

The AWS Lambda Authorizer Trigger Function is designed to secure the Amazon API gateway by leveraging OAuth 2.0 JWT tokens provided by Okta. Once deployed, this function acts as a gatekeeper, authenticating incoming requests the Amazon API gateway endpoint. It verifies JWT tokens to ensure that they are valid and have been issued by Okta. This setup is critical for maintaining secure access and preventing unauthorized use of your Amazon API gateway endpoint.

1. **Open the Lambda console** at [AWS Lambda Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

## Save Messages in DynamoDB

**Note**: For converting text to speech, AWS End User Messaging uses Amazon Polly, which offers a variety of language options. In this example, we're focusing on English and Spanish language support. If your requirements include additional languages, please see the [Amazon Polly Voice List](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/docs/voicelist/) to determine the appropriate language codes and voice IDs. To incorporate these languages into your setup, reference the format provided in the 'English-Spanish-Data.txt' file, which outlines how messages are structured in DynamoDB. Then follow these steps to store language data into DynamoDB.

Use the following steps to enter data into a DynamoDB table via the DynamoDB console. DynamoDB serves as a repository for storing message content in different languages, which is then sent to users. This guide focuses on how to store message templates in both English and Spanish for SMS and voice communications.

1. **Open the DynamoDB console** at [AWS DynamoDB Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/).

2. In the navigation pane on the left side of the console, choose **Tables**.

</p>

## Deployment Validation

To validate the deployment, follow these steps:

1. **Verify AWS CloudFormation Stack**
   - In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the CloudFormation service.
   - Locate the stack you created for this deployment and confirm that the status is "CREATE_COMPLETE".
   - Review the stack outputs to ensure that all required resources (Lambda functions, API Gateway, DynamoDB table, etc.) have been successfully created.

2. **Verify Lambda Functions**
   - Open the AWS Lambda console and locate the two Lambda functions deployed by the CloudFormation stack:
     - **Lambda API Trigger Function**: Verify you adjust the code to reference the proper AWS region where the lambda is being launched. Also, make sure the proper environment variables are set in the Lambda Function configuration. You must have `DYNAMODB_TABLE_NAME`. Also verify the `node_modules`, `originationIdentities.json`, `index.js`, `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files/folders are inside the Lambda code source.
     - **Lambda Authorizer Trigger Function**: Verify the `node_modules`, `index.js`, `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files/folders are inside the Lambda code source.

3. **Verify the API Gateway Configuration**:
   - In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the API Gateway service.
   - Locate the API created by the CloudFormation stack and review the configuration, including the deployed stage and method.

4. **Validate the DynamoDB Table**:
   - Open the Amazon DynamoDB console and locate the table created by the CloudFormation stack.
   - Verify that the table has the expected structure and that the sample data you added earlier is present.

5. **Verify the Inline Hook:**
   - In the Okta Admin Console, navigate to the **Workflow > Inline Hooks** section.
   - Locate the Inline Hook you created for the Amazon API Gateway integration and confirm that it is listed correctly.

## Running the Guidance

1. Return to the Okta Admin console **Workflow > Inline Hooks** page and click on your Inline Hook.

2. Navigate to the **Preview** tab.

3. **Configure Test**:
   - For user profile, select a user.
   - For requestType, select **MFA Verification**.

4. **Generate and Edit Request**:
   - Click on **Generate Request**.
   - Click on **Edit**.
   - Edit `phoneNumber` with your destination phone number.
   - Edit `deliveryChannel` to `voice call` instead of SMS.
   - **Note:** For this test, the long code associated with the AWS End User Messaging account supports only voice communications. If your assigned long code or short code supports SMS, you can configure it to use SMS as needed.
   - Edit `locale` to `en` instead of EN-US. This will test a voice call using our voice english template.

5. **Submit Request**: Click `Save` and then on the `View Response` button.

   **Okta Successful Response:** 
<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/images/Response.jpg" alt="Okta Response:" width="800"/>
</p>

6. **Interpreting Output**
Observe the Response: The Okta Console will display the response from the Amazon API Gateway in JSON format. Verify that the response includes the following:
   
   -Status Code: The response should have a status code of "Successful", indicating a successful request.

   -Provider: The response should include the Provider which is the name of the Okta inline hook.

   -Transition ID: The response should also include a transaction ID. 
   
   -Verify the Phone Call: If the test was successful, you should receive a phone call or SMS on the specified number.

By following these steps, you can validate the proper functioning of the Okta phone-based multi-factor authentication solution on AWS, ensuring that the OTP delivery process is working as expected.

## Next Steps

To activate the Okta Inline Hook and enable it to handle login requests, follow these next steps:

1. **Update an Okta Authentication Policy**: Update a preset or new authentication policy by adding a new rule. These MFA capabilities can be applied to MFA use cases where SMS or voice-based MFA is needed to log into Okta or various Okta-integrated applications such as AWS, Salesforce, and more. To enable this, you need to activate the `Phone` authenticator under the `Authenticators` section in Okta, which will allow users to enroll their mobile phone numbers for SMS or voice-based authentication.

2. **Expand Language Support**: The current implementation focuses on English and Spanish language support for SMS and voice communications. Consider adding support for additional languages by adding message templates in the DynamoDB table. Reference the [Amazon Polly Voice List](https://aws.amazon.com/polly/docs/voicelist/) to determine the appropriate language codes and voice IDs for your requirements.

3. **Add Additional Countries to originationIdentities.json**: As your user base expands to different countries, update the originationIdentities.json file by adding new entries for the respective country codes. Ensure that the origination identities (phone numbers, Sender IDs, short codes, ARNs, etc.) are registered with your AWS Account and listed within the AWS End User Messaging Service Dashboard. 

4. **Implement Dynamic Message Personalization**: You can dynamically personalize the messages templates. This can be done by editing or adding new message templates in the DynamoDB table.

5. **Enhance Security Measures**: Consider adding additional managed or custom AWS WAF rules based on your specific security requirements and threat landscape. 

## Clean Up

Follow these steps to properly remove the resources and ensure that your AWS account and Okta configuration do not continue to be charged.

1. **Delete AWS CloudFormation Stacks**: Navigate to the AWS CloudFormation console and delete the stack you have deployed. This action removes all resources associated with those stacks, including AWS Lambda functions, Amazon API Gateways, Amazon DynamoDB tables, and any other related services.

2. **Revoke Okta Inline Hooks and API Tokens**: In the Okta Admin Console, remove any Inline Hooks you have set up and delete any API tokens or sessions created for this integration to ensure that no unwanted operations remain active.

By following these clean-up steps, you ensure that all temporary configurations and resources are properly decommissioned.
